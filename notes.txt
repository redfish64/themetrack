We have a python parser for each filetype, ib, schwab, capex

We have a directory of files to load to produce a result.
We may in the future allow api driven access to data, and this could be saved to a directory if the user wants

There are two main functions:
1. Populate the data directory. This includes override rules, forex data, brokerage reports, and capex reports.
2. Process the data directory to a result directory, which includes debugging files, associations between rows in 
holdings and picks to override_rules, and an error/warning report. 

Note that we always start from the input data, because we don't want to have conditions like having to refresh the master of record, and then
produce reports as two separate steps. It's confusing.

We will end up with a few classes:
Holding - a position that is held by the account
Pick - a pick of a particular stock

Forex value date. This will be taken from the brokerage report date. Since the brokerage report also 
displays the current value, then, it only makes sense that we convert the currency on that date. 
If we took the current value indepedently, from the web or something, then it may make more sense
to use a different date.

We start with a "snapshot". A snapshot has 3 subdirs as above, data, master_record, and reports
 
So from the user interface there is a function "create snapshot", with an option to copy over the last snapshots 
user overrides.

Then we start the first step for gathering data. Have screens for brokerage reports, capex reports, and forex.

Then the user hits go, we do the master of record, report any errors or warnings, and include them in the master of record
subdir. Also an association between each row in the brokerage/capex and each override rule, for debugging.
