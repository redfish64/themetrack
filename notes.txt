directory: may contain a date, so maybe "[date]_<dir_name> "2024_04_11_...."
file: [date (optional)]_<holdings|pick|notes>_<file_type1>_<file_type2...>.csv
<file_type1>, <file_type2>, etc. can be anything and along with <holdings|rec|notes> is matched against template name. 
so for example, you could have "holdings_ib_activity". A template that starts with the same file types will
be looked for. So if there is a file template "holdings_ib.fsm", it would be chosen to parse the file data.
Or if you have pick_capex_big5, and there is a template "pick_capex.fsm" it would be used.
If categories overlap, we'll have an option to decide how to print the result:
  1. Print total amount duplicated for all categories
  2. Split amount across categories

We don't want to reimplement a spreadsheet, so we're not going to do any summary tables. We'll just do matching.


We should be loose as far as currency and numbers. IOW, accept "-$1,000,000", "$(1,000,000)", "($1,000,000)","(1,000,000)","(1000000)", etc.
Otherwise its needlessly complex to make a data file

In csvfsm we should convert values directly to their native types. So that, if we have Value BuyDate Date, then the data within
the result is a date type.

But with stock, that's the tricky one, because we need to join based on something, and stock is not always named the same thing.
