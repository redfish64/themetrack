We have a python parser for each filetype, ib, schwab, capex, tdameritrade

We have a directory of files to load to produce a result.
We may in the future allow api driven access to data, and this could be saved to a directory if the user wants

Each parser will determine the names, and how to interpret each field


We will end up with a few classes:
Holding - a position that is held by the account
Pick - a pick of a particular stock

browser cookies can be grabbed using this project, I guess:

There will also be a user editable config file that specified mappings between stocks and picks and maybe other things.
Here is an example:

FileType	Match		Replacement	
CapexBig5	Market	NYSEAMERICAN	Market	NYSE
CapexBig5	Market	Foobar	Symbol	Nerf
	Symbol	Jerf		
CapexBig5	Market	US	Market	NYSE,AMEX,NASDAQ

There are groups, so that whenever there is a non empty FileType, then a new record is created
Each record will match specified columns, and then if they match, the replacement is run

Replacement records will run in order. User replacements will be forst.
specifies "Market:NYSEAMERICAN,Symbol:Foo" -> Symbol:Foo2 then it would match even though
there is a Market:NYSEAMERICAN -> Market:NYSE

Any column can be matched and any column can be set. This way a Theme can be manually set
for specific symbols, "Symbol:XZY" -> "Theme:SuperBestTheme"

Matched records will be recorded in a "Override Notes" column for each row.

We can even do re, by prefixing with "re:" if necessary.
