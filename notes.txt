We have a python parser for each filetype, ib, schwab, capex, tdameritrade

We have a directory of files to load to produce a result.
We may in the future allow api driven access to data, and this could be saved to a directory if the user wants

Each parser will determine the names, and how to interpret each field

There will also be a user editable config file that specified mappings between stocks and picks and maybe other things


We will end up with a few classes:
Holding - a position that is held by the account
Pick - a pick of a particular stock
